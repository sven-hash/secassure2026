# Security Scanner

Kotlin/Docker-based email security scanner that tests DANE/DNSSEC and email authentication (SPF, DMARC) for municipality email domains.

## Usage

Invoked via the project CLI:

```bash
uv run scan ch    # scan Swiss municipalities
uv run scan de    # scan German municipalities
uv run scan at    # scan Austrian municipalities
uv run scan ch -v # verbose (streams Docker output)
uv run scan ch --mta-sts-only -v # DNS/HTTPS only; no Docker required
```

`--mta-sts-only` refreshes the policy status in
`output/security/security_{cc}.json`, preserving other security results. If
that file exists, its domains are scanned without requiring domain resolver
output. Otherwise, a new file is created from `output/domains/domains_{cc}.json`
with the other checks left unchecked. The MTA-STS-only check runs in Python,
requires DNS/HTTPS access, and does not need outbound SMTP port 25.

## Prerequisites

- Docker (with `docker compose` v2 or `docker-compose` v1)
- Domain resolver output in `output/domains/domains_{cc}.json`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **DANE/TLSA scanning requires unrestricted outbound port 25 (SMTP).** The `gotls` tool connects to MX servers on port 25 to validate TLS certificates against TLSA records. Most residential ISPs and macOS/Docker Desktop environments block outbound SMTP, causing all DANE checks to fail while SPF/DMARC results remain correct (DNS-only).
>
> Verify port 25 access:
> ```bash
> nc -z -w5 mta-gw.infomaniak.ch 25 && echo "open" || echo "blocked"
> ```

## Architecture

- **scanner/** — Kotlin app that resolves MX records and runs TLS, DANE, and DSS probes against each domain
- **evaluator/** — Kotlin app that aggregates raw scan results into per-domain security assessments
- **docker-compose.yaml** — Orchestrates both containers with shared volumes

The Python wrapper in `src/mail_municipalities/security_analysis/runner.py` handles input/output transformation and Docker invocation.

## Dependencies

Both containers are built from `eclipse-temurin:11-jdk` (Java 11). The scanner container bundles several external tools:
